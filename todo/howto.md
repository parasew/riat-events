## Process in detail

### Events

1. Find a missing event from the [todo list](readme.md)
1. Create a new folder in the structure (example) "2014-02-27-artisticbokeh-too-much-money-exhibition"
1. name the only file in the folder "readme.md"
1. enter the content by using a template, for example this one here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parasew/riat-events/master/events/2020-03-13-10th-ohs-nyc/readme.md
1. Search the [artisticbokeh flickr page](https://www.flickr.com/photos/artisticbokeh/albums) for an nice poster image and copy the URL to the image.
1. If no matching foto is found, find a CC0 or other public domain photo from the interwebs.
1. Here is a good example of a full entry, with all bells and whistles:

### Event overview

* once the event is created, please make sure it is mentioned and linked in the [event overview](https://github.com/parasew/riat-events/tree/master/archive)

### Suggested tech and tools for the Process

* We are using Github, with the [atom editor](https://atom.io)
* A suggested package for the markdown-tables is the [table-editor](https://atom.io/packages/table-editor) plugin, which makes it easier to handle the markdown tables.
