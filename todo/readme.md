# TODO for the RIAT archive

This is a catch-all place for all things that still need work.

# What is the reason for this?
The main aim is, is to have a central point for past events of the [RIAT Institute](https://riat.at). The institute exists since quite some time, and documentation is scattered in many places. This repo is here to help, and also feeds the RIAT website.

# What can I do?
If you find something online or missing, [please open an issue](https://github.com/parasew/riat-events/issues/new) or create a pull request. You can [read the howto](howto.md) in order to understand better how to contribute. The [events archive](https://github.com/parasew/riat-events/tree/master/archive) usually is a good starting point.

## Events
Events are our main concern (but see the other places where you could help also listed below).

### Identifying missing events
You can browse through the events lists and see if all the events you participated are actually listed. [Please open an issue](https://github.com/parasew/riat-events/issues/new) if you found somethin missing.

### Going through events you participated in 
If you have been a speaker or co-organiser, please check those events first and see if there is something missing.
* consider adding slides or any other material into the "materials" folder of a specific event.
* If you have photos for the event, please add them to the repository in an "images" folder.
* In case you wrote some content or want to help brushing up some events, please also do so!
* If you know of other people who participated, please also direct them towards this site, so they can check the content and help out.

### Collecting external links and references
We are collecting external links and references to events, so please make sure to add those in the "References" section of the individual events. An example is given below:

* An example for an event is [this one from 2014](https://github.com/parasew/riat-events/tree/master/events/2014-02-27-artisticbokeh-too-much-money-exhibition), which is titled "Too Much Money", an exhibition in our venue in Museumsquartier Vienna.
* When [searching google for "Too Much Money ArtisticBokeh"](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=GBdeX_D2HNKtkgX40ZuwBA&q=too+much+money+artisticbokeh&oq=too+much+money+artisticbokeh&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoCCAA6AgguOggILhDHARCjAjoLCC4QxwEQowIQkwI6BQguEJMCOggILhDHARCvAToECAAQCjoHCC4QChCTAjoECC4QCjoHCC4QDRCTAjoECC4QDToECAAQDToGCAAQFhAeOggIIRAWEB0QHjoHCCEQChCgAVD0CliGT2DGUWgGcAB4AYABsAKIAfkrkgEIMC4zMS4yLjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjw4qSfl-brAhXSlqQKHfjoBkYQ4dUDCAY&uact=5) we find a lot of resources which have not been processed:
