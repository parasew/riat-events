# [Coded Cultures Openism] Open Maps Exhibition

Join us to launch the Open Maps exhibition, and pick up a copy of the riso print created by Tactical Space Lab director Josh Harle to accompany the exhibition.

OpenMaps is an open digital mapping platform developed by Tactical Space Labs to encourage alternative ways of understanding build space. As part of the Coded Cultures Openism festival TSL hosted a 2-day workshop to create and share more diverse, creative, and expressive digital maps.

The exhibition of outcomes will be take place from 23rd to 28th May, at various venues in central Vienna (viewable as open hotspots - bring a WiFi-enabled device). It will feature the works of artists Ingrid Burrington (US), Daniel Benedek (AT), Benny Nilson (GER), Josh Harle (AU), and a digital map adaptation of 'Unser Wien: arisierung auf Ã¶sterreichisch' by historian Stephan Templ.
