Hi all!

We would like to meet again! And of course we want to look at an interesting and important topic again. Last time, we were able to discuss the topic of sensible service design with Uwe Friedrichsen from Germany. This time we will welcome one of our local austrian software heroes, David Leitner! David will look at an often underestimated and tricky topic: how to extend the ideas and concepts of microservices to the frontend world?

David writes:

"Microservices brought us significant benefits, which allow us to structure teams based on business capabilities, improve scalability and enable the flexibility of being polyglot. Unfortunately, these powerful architectures are often complemented by a feature-rich browser application which ends up way too often in the creation of as a single, big and sprawling frontend-monolith.

The approach of micro frontends is an effective strategy to tackle this problem and first appeared at the end of 2016 on the ThoughtWorks Technology Radar. By going into detail about the idea of extending the concepts of microservices to the frontend world, the importance of end-to-end verticals, the difference of an orchestration- or choreography-based implementation, and the trade-offs in reusability become reasonable.

Upon a closer look at the advantages and challenges you’ve experienced in customer projects, it turns out that micro frontends are not a silver bullet either. Rather, they are suited for a specific set of problems. In a nutshell, micro frontends can be a powerful tool to avoid frontend monoliths and this talk will give you the needed knowledge to decide if it’s the right one for the job."

David Leitner is an Enthusiastic Software Professional from Vienna who is working in various projects using a bunch of different stacks and environments. He spends much of his time on the frontlines tackling the challenges of scaling software and complex domains. A software engineer by day - a javascript ninja by night - who is preferring his code simple and small instead of clever and edgy. David enjoys sharing his knowledge as speaker at international conferences and as a lecturer for his post-diploma courses at the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Vienna.
