We have two great presenters lined up, Markus Sabadello (Danube Tech) and Robert Mitwicki (Lab 10 Collective) will be speaking on self sovereign identity topics.

This will be a technical meetup....

Markus will be presenting on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs); the idea, origin and rationale behind them.

Robert will be speaking on ID Proofing; using signals and artifacts to prove who you are.

I would also like to announce that the meetup is sponsored by Danube Tech.
