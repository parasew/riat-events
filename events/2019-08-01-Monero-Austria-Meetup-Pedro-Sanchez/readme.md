We invite everyone to the Monero Austria Meetup on 1.August 2019, 18:00 CEST.

Main element of the Meetup will be a "deep dive" by Pedro Moreno-Sanchez (post-doc at the Security and Privacy Research Division at TU Vienna). He will present a deep-dive of "Dual Outputs: Enabling Payment-Channel Networks in Monero (DLSAG)" - you can watch his overview in the presentation he was giving at MoneroKon.

The second highlight of the Meetup will be an overview and status of Monero-GUI by selsta.

Parasew will give a recap of the recent Monero Konferenco in Denver, USA and will give a brief overview of "Open and Libre Hardware with Monero". We will further look at all things Monero such as: the upcoming Monero Village at DEF CON and we start planning of the 36c3.
