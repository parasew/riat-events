This time we will look at the recent issues with the Constantinople Hardfork.

Agenda:

1) Constantinople and Petersburg

In January the Constantinople Hardfork got delayed yet again due to some potential security implications of one of its EIPs.

We will look at
* what led to the postponement
* how this situation was handled by the developers
* the "Petersburg" Hardfork
* some proposed solutions for the EIP in question
* concerns about CREATE2

2) Socializing

Afterwards feel free to chat with other cryptocurrency enthusiasts about Ethereum or whatever else you find interesting.
