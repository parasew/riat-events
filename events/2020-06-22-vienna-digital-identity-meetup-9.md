We will be meeting at both RIAT and online through Zoom.

Since we last met, there has been a lot of activity within the sector with major announcements from organizations like Mastercard and Microsoft and the recently completed phase 1 interoperability testing done by the Department of Homeland Security in the US.

The Meetup will consist of two parts:

1. General update on Digital Identity sector - Michael Shea
2. Update on DHS Interoperability Test - Markus Sabadello

I hope you can join us in RIAT on Monday, evening or online if you can't be in person.
