RIAT ESSENTIALS is a new workshop series for the improvement of business models, evaluation and validation of research-driven projects.

RIAT has a long and vivid history of mentoring and developing research applications for science, science communication and technical projects in Austria and throughout Europe.

In this event, RIAT introduces the series and discusses the experiences and pitfalls for startups and young companies, with an emphasis on blockchain and open hardware sectors.

In this event we welcome founders, startups and companies who are interested in developing their business models as well as R+D projects. We will outline the program series, which covers ideation, business model development, business planning and "funding ready".
