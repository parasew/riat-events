![Too much money](https://live.staticflickr.com/7373/12817078373_fbac1d9312_o_d.jpg)

In a site-specific installation, Artistic Bokeh presents a collaboration with Georgios Papadopoulos (GR) and Société Réaliste (FR) thematizing the symbolic value of artistic production and its subordination by the valuation of markets.

> "There is never enough money, especially for cultural production; but also too much since money and market tend to impose their interpretation of artistic and cultural value. The system of prices organizes an order of meaning, where taste, subjectivity and community are reconfigured according to the mandates and the geopolitics of the market. In this hostile environment, the artist needs to create new possibilities of independence at the same time as she has to survive and thrive, despite the exploitative conditions of employment that more often than not define artistic work. Too Much Money is not the solution, but a tiny reminder of the poverty of the artist in a system that celebrates (and profits from) the value of art."
(Text: G.Papadopoulos)

A lecture-performance of C.Lisecki / G.Papadopoulos will mark the opening on Thursday, February 27, accompanied by the film screening of "Art Accounts Deutsche Bank (2013)" by Carsten Lisecki.
