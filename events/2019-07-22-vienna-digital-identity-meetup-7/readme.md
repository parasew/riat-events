Next meetup is back to the regular schedule of 4th Monday of each month. This month we will have another 'Zoom-in' presentation.

Philip Sheldrake from Euler Partners and Ashoka Foundation will be presenting on "Interpersonal data, identity and relationships".

We will also be holding a wrap-up session for the Riddle&Code Decentralized IDs workshop. JÃ¼rgen Eckel will be presenting the what was produce during the workshop.

I hope you can include this event into your busy schedule!
