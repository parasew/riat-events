October is Open Hardware Month - and OSHWA (the Open Source Hardware Association) is calling for worldwide action in the name of Open Hardware. RIAT will be hosting the format “Open Hardware Dialogues”, which follows the footsteps of a RIAT publication with the name “Openism - Conversations in Open Hardware”. This publication sheds light into the motivations and different open source strategies, as well as the different levels of openness in open design movements.

** Open Hardware Month Kick-Off and Apertus AXIOM showcase: 2019-10-01, Vienna (AT) **

Open Hardware Dialogues starts with an event on October 1st in Vienna, which is organised together with Apertus AXIOM Open Source Cinema. This event will showcase prototypes, experiences and other insights of over 10 years of open hardware development at Apertus - which is the first fully open professional cinema camera. A strong focus will be set on the AXIOM Beta, a professional digital cinema camera built around FOSS and open hardware licenses.

The event will further contextualize the OSHWA Open Hardware Month, and will give an overview of other hardware projects such as the cryptography hardware of Riddle+Code, an Austria based company with which RIAT has been previously developing cryptography+hardware workshops with.

On this evening, visitors will learn about the Apertus AXIOM project, as well as other Open Hardware related topics. The program will feature different speakers from the Open Hardware movement and will also kick-off "Open Hardware Month" as well as "Open Hardware Dialogues".

The event is free of charge, please come early and make sure to register in order to have a confirmed seat.
