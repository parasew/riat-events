![Decentral Community at 36C3](https://live.staticflickr.com/8754/17300538715_718c57b25e_o_d.jpg)

[Decentral.Community](https://decentral.community) (dubbed the "Critical Decentralisation Cluster") is an initiative started by RIAT and the Monero Community - and which runs since 2015 as part of the Chaos Communication Congress.

Its aims are:

* To critically discuss decentralisation in all its facets: thematizing privacy vs. transparency, private cryptocurrency, headless organisations, immutable code, future (code) governance and open vs. libre technologies.
* To discuss Open Hardware, libre hardware and its limits.
* To provide a space for exchange and outreach in the context of privacy technologies.
* To foster interdisciplinary work and an inclusive practice to improve crypto-literacy as well as technological literacy.
* To advocate critical projects and intitiatives in this context and to open them up to a larger audience of peers.
* To test and create new workshops, materials and videos for media.ccc.de

One dedicated aim of the cluster is to accumulate the necessary infrastructure to organise it every year at the C3, and to have this available also throughout the year for events, presentations and workshops. Initial donations have been made by XMR.TO and a few anonymous individuals, hardware and equipment have been provided by RIAT. Most of the expenses have been made by individuals, you can support us with donations in crypto, fiat or equipment :)

We are also using the setting at C3 in order to gain insights for future events - in this context we are evaluating different tools and workflows to support future events such as the Monero Konferenco. We are testing conference management, recording and streaming, as well as best-practices.

The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) is the largest (and oldest) hacker association in Europe and was founded in 1981. Originating from Germany, it has spread over Europe and organizes numerous events, such as the annual Chaos Communication Congress. The congress takes place between christmas and new years eve, since 1984. It is considered one of the largest (over 15,000 attendees) events of this kind, alongside the DEF CON in Las Vegas.
