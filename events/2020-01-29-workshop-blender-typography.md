Details:

We'll be looking at how to create animated 2D and 3D typography in Blender. This is for complete beginners (and surely interesting to advanced users too)!

Feel free to bring your own topics and questions as well: Animated outlines, bouncy fonts, tumbling letters, rotating glyphs, "shadow" writing, so much is possible in Blender and we can gladly look at specific things if the audience - you - requests it. :)

Don't forget to bring your laptop - you don't need one to attend but you'll get so much more from the workshop if you're able to try things out right there!

Big thanks to riat.at for hosting us at their place!
