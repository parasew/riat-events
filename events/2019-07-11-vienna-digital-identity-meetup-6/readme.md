We are going to have a slightly different format for Meetup #6, the guys from Holochain are going to be presenting. 

The first part of their presentation will be on the DPKI, Holochain's identity management system, and then it's up to your interests to guide the conversation.

Art Brock, Holochain's founder and Eric Bear, Holochain Community Manager will be the featured presenters for Meetup #6.
