# 72nd Bitcoin Austria Meetup : Atomic Swaps

## 1. Atomic Swaps (Andreas Petersson)

## 2. comit.network (Daniel Karzel)

We first take a look at the state of the art of cross-blockchain solutions and then focus on atomic swaps using hash time locked contracts.  We give an overview of our current research topics around privacy and off-chain solutions. Finally there will be a short live demo of getting started with COMIT – https://github.com/comit-network – the open source protocol facilitating cross-blockchain applications.

## 3. Pantos (Lukas Pfeiffer)

Bitpanda and Pantos: The future of tokenization and blockchain interoperability; ca 15-25min

Ever since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, many new blockchain-based projects have been launched. The recent surge of these alternatives indicates a movement away from a single cryptocurrency focus to a variety of cryptocurrency-based applications built on top of blockchain-based technology. However, with the current lack of interoperability between blockchains, projects risk ending up as separate islands, which ultimately slows down mass adoption of blockchain technology.

Interoperability between blockchains remains an open problem with current interoperability approaches providing very limited means of cross-blockchain interaction. In particular, current solutions for cross-blockchain token transfers suffer from limitations such as excessive synchronization of any balance change across blockchains. To overcome these limitations, Bitpanda and the TU Wien joined forces to work on enabling decentralized cross-blockchain applications such as cross-blockchain token transfers.

In our talk we will dive into the future of tokenization, what role Bitpanda and Pantos will play in this and how we are working on improving blockchain interoperability.
