Join us for a talk by our partner institute RIAT from Vienna.

RIAT (founded in 2012) is an institute for research, development, communication and education in the fields of cryptoeconomics and the blockchain.

It is an honour to have Matthias Tarasiewicz, Director of RIAT, and Ralph Pichler, Lead RIAT Ethereum Academy, in-house and gain insights about their independent institute.

RIAT is home to projects such as:
* DARC Laboratory for Future Cryptoeconomics
* Journal for Cryptoeconomics
* Coded Cultures > Making Artistic Technology
* the Laboratory of Future Cryptoeconomics at Ethereum Devcon3
..and many more.

"We work with experimental artistic technology and open hardware. We explore and actively stress-test the role of research and development in the age of zero-trust, through novel forms of presentation, discussion and publication. Examining the global cryptoeconomic condition and its effects on culture and society, we foster an open and interdisciplinary discourse to improve crypto-literacy for the society of tomorrow and foster the adoption of cryptography and privacy technologies across disciplines."
