It's the first meetup of the year. This time we are joined by Emilie from ODEM and Peter from Bitfly. First we will have a quick update about things related to Ethereum. Then Emilie will talk about ODEM. Finally Peter will talk about etherchain and some metrics of the blockchain.

Agenda

1) Updates

A quick update about recent happenings in the Ethereum world.

2) ODEM - On-Demand Education Marketplace

Emilie Raffo, organizer of the Swiss "Blockchain 4 Good" meetup (https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain4Good-Rocks/), will talk about the use of blockchain technology to make education accessible to all. She will present the usecase of ODEM: the "On-Demand Education Marketplace" (http://odem.io/) that leverages Blockhain technology and AI to offer the best contents and certifications to ALL students, whatever their net-worth, and whatever their origin.

3) Exploring the Ethereum Blockchain

This talk gives a look behind the scenes of developping and operating etherchain.org (http://etherchain.org/), the first Ethereum Blockchain Explorer. Furthermore we discuss and analyze key metrics of the Ethereum network collected by the Blochchain explorer and give an in depth view on the challenges faced in scaling Ethereum from the point of view of a mining pool.
