# [Making Artistic Technology] Trans/mission: The power & value of sharing commons

A two-day workshop theory and praxis on the power & value of sharing commons. Experimental trans/communicative techniques with Q21/RIAT artist-in residence Víctor Mazón Gardoqui.

This workshop is aimed at participants interested in sound, transmission, radio art, radio history, acoustics, perception, field recordings, experimental & communicative processes, and dedicated artists, musicians, sound designers, performers, hackers, DIY enthusiasts and curious minds.

Workshop attendees have the option between building two seperate devices.

TRANS/MISSION Device (Cost €99)
A non-regulated autonomous FM transmitter capable of broadcast over the whole FM spectrum (87-108MHz) with an integrated high quality USB soundcard with Stereo Input/Output at 48KHz running on any operating system (Linux/OSX/Windows/Android).

TRANS/MISSION “Mithos" Version (Cost €49)
A compact version of the Trans/mission device, sharing the same technique for broadcast analog frequency modulated audio signals over the whole FM radio spectrum (87-108MHz) with a stereo jack input and an SMA antenna conector. The device has a printed USB connector for power operation allowing you to broadcast locally FM audio signals and analog black and white video.

No previous electronic or sound skills are necessary to perform these experiments and every experiment can be realized with the specific electronics provided in the workshop, including the Trans/mission device.

The workshop will introduce the participants to audio sonification techniques, active listening and optimal signal reception of radio signals, covering theoretical and practical topics related to transmission, the power of sharing information, radio history, construction of electronic devices and establishing guidelines for experimental transmission techniques.

During the workshop attendees will have the chance to build a dedicated short range transmitter device with a dedicated USB soundcard which works on any operating system and software. At the end of the workshop, all built modules will be tested and adjusted for proper operation.

The workshop will take place over two days. Saturday November 26th from 12:00-16:00 and on Sunday November 27th from 11:00-19:00.

No specific electronic or sound experience needed. Patience is mandatory.
