RIAT Research Institute for Arts & Technology continues its Cryptoeconomics: Infrastructures & Artefacts program with an installation of 'Proof-of-Presence' from DARC at its exhibition space for the STARTS Prize at the Ars Electronica Festival 2017.

'Proof-of-presence' is a blockchain that critically responds to the cryptoeconomy that has emerged around the notion of zero-trust that was initially proposed with Bitcoin. In contrast to the mantra of Bitcoin: “In Math We Trust”, the 'Proof-of-Presence' asks for ‘blind trust’ through faith. Pilgrims to Proof-of-presence are provided RFID embedded prayer beads before visiting its shrine which is centrally located within the enclosed space.

While Bitcoin is based on generating value through ‘Proof-of-work’ - where cryptographic ‘work’ is undertaken by the machine/computer - 'Proof-of-presence' reveals how the narratives of machine labour as utopia/dystopia are immaterial.

During the exhibition period at Ars Electronica, RIAT will also be hosting free blockchain workshops from its upcoming RIAT Academy. There will also be presentations from Hmpshr Mx on the Terra0 project and from Martin Reinhart on Data Loam. RSVP to the facebook event to be updated on further details.
