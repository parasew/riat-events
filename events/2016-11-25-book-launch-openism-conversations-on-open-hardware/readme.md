# [Book Launch] Openism: Conversations on Open Hardware

RIAT Research Institute for Arts & Technology is pleased to invite you to our new space on Friday, November 25th for the launch of the book 'Openism: Conversations on Open Hardware' edited by Andrew Newman, Matthias Tarasiewicz, Sophie-Carolin Wagner and Stefanie Wuschitz. The launch will feature a short discussion between the editors of the book and will be followed by experimental sound performances from Karl Salzmann and Víctor Mazón Gardoqui.

'Openism' unravels the varying perspectives of key practitioners and theoreticians on the development of open hardware across the globe including Richard Stallman, Joshua Pearce, Andrew Huang, Katherine Scott, Madeline Gannon, Silvia Lindtner among others. In a series of conversations, the potential for, and the consequence of an openism approach is demonstrated through stories of 3D-printed stethoscopes in the gaza strip, hacked open Xboxes, trained robots, DIY gynecological equipment and complete science labs built out of open hardware.

Openism is published by the University of Applied Arts Vienna, in cooperation with RIAT and continent.journal. Design is by Christoph Schörkhuber.

Please join us at our new space and have a drink with us.

Karl Salzmann [AT] is a sound artist that works within processual and experimental setups. He develops and presents
works that study the materiality of sound and its social, cultural and metaphorical levels of meaning. His artistic activities mainly concern the interaction between sound and visual arts and often relate to works and topics of (sound) art history.

Víctor Mazón Gardoqui [ES] works through actions, arrangements and obstructions -between- sound materiality and dislocated information. His work questions perception, altered state and vulnerability through un/stable arrangements. Mazón Gardoqui is currently the RIAT recommended artist-in-residence at Q21 MQ – MuseumsQuartier Wien.
