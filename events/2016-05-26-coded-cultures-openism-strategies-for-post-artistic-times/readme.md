# [Coded Cultures Openism] Strategies for Post-artistic times

Join curator Kuba Szreder [PL], artist and researcher Teresa Dillon [IE] and the RIAT artists and researchers Andrew Newman [AU], Matthias Parasew Tarasiewicz [AT] and Sophie Carolin Wagner [AT] for an informal discussion on the myth of autonomous art, the issue of art washing, and the unreality of "artistic research". What are strategies for post-artistic times?

Kuba Szreder recently curated the exhibition 'Making Use: Life in Postartistic Times' with Sebastian Cichocki at the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw.He works as an “independent” curator, and his interdisciplinary curatorial projects combine artistic practices with critical examination of society. In 2009, together with Bęc Zmiana Foundation and other colleagues, he initiated Free/Slow University of Warsaw. His theoretical research reflects upon the apparatuses of contemporary artistic production and their socio-economic context. In the Summer of 2015, he was awarded a practice-based PhD from Loughborough University School of the Arts. His thesis scrutinizes economic and governmental aspects of project-making and their impact on an “independent” curatorial practice. Kuba Szreder is based in London and Warsaw.

Teresa Dillon explores techno-civic interfaces and relationships through art, performance & sound. Her background is in site-based performance, stage design and theatre, with a PhD in educational psychology including applied experience in developing digital tools, educational software, curricula and policy. She has experience in curating artistic programmes that address civic and contemporary digital life and the interfaces between disciplinary knowledges. Dillon is currently Humboldt Fellow, UdK & TU, Berlin researching how artists make the electromagnetic spectrum audible and its relationship to citizenship, “Smart City” governance and activism. Developing new work, which focuses on military based sound reenactments and free-to-use Urban Huts.

Andrew Newman is an artist and researcher based between Sydney and Vienna. His performative art practice poetically utilises methodologies from the communication sciences to examine value construction in contemporary culture. He has been researching cryptocurrencies at the Artistic Technology Lab at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna since 2013 and is currently investigating artistic knowledge production as a PhD candidate at the National Institute for Experimental Arts in Australia. He is a director and editorial board member of the journal Runway Australian Experimental Arts and editor for the upcoming Journal for Research Cultures: Epistemic Practices in Arts and Technology. Newman completed his MFA in Media Arts at the Sydney College of the Arts and the Berlin University of the Arts and his MA in Communication at the University of Technology Sydney and the University of Hamburg. Newman is the director of the Austria Australia Arts Alliance which creates an exchange of experimental art positions between Austrian and Australian researchers and artists.

Matthias Tarasiewicz founded the CODED CULTURES initiative (media arts festival and research platform) and is active as curator, researcher and technology theorist since the last millenium. Deeply involved in coding and decoding (both literally and theoretically) he researches in the fields of artistic technologies, experimental documentation and cryptocurrencies. His work BitCoincloud received various prizes and has been shown internationally since 2010. He currently works as Editor-in-chief of the Journal for Research Cultures, runs the Artistic Bokeh initiative and is project lead of Artistic Technology Research at the University of Applied Arts, Vienna.

Sophie-Carolin Wagner investigates elaborately, works passionately, quotes vigorously, writes peripatetically, communicates epistemologically, but not necessarily insightfully, holds as many degrees as names and never signed up to Facebook. She lives and works in Vienna, currently as researcher at the at Artistic Technology Research Lab, Co-Editor of the Journal for Research Cultures and board member of the Research Institute for Arts and Technology.
