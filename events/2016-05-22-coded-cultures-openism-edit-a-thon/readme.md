# [Coded Cultures Openism] Edit-a-thon

Wikipedia seems like an open, participatory platform, but in fact 90 percent of its editors are male.

At the EDIT-A-THON hosted by Mz* Baltazar’s Laboratory you can drop in and find out how to publish and how to edit an article, add information about women in technology/art/activism or even develop your own Wikipedia article!

To encourage a representative number of articles from a female perspective, the US-based feminist organization ‘art+feminism' created a format called ‘Edit-a-thon‘. It has its roots in the term ‘hacker-thon‘, a night and day-long working session among hackers who try to collaboratively get Open Source projects done. The ‘Edit-a-thon’ in Vienna will become the most intense working session of feminist article writing ever! A networked wikistorming during which feminists on different locations in the world will reclaim Wikipedia!

Have you ever wondered how wikipedia is structured? How controversial issues are handled? How it reflects what the world thinks? Is it at all possible to give a global perspective? How many changes are done each minute on one article on Wikipedia? Who checks the information? Do editors have to follow any rules? These are a number of questions we will debate during the Edit-a-Thon, while eating yummy cake and drinking delicious tea/coffee.
As with all our workshops with the intent of creating safer spaces this one is also for Women*, Inter*, Trans* (FLIT) folk only.

Mz* Baltazar’s Laboratory is a collective and feminist hackerspace. It aims at generating a culture of fearless making and an environment that fosters creativity, activism and provokative thinking. Mz* Baltazar’s Lab tries to build an accessible, inclusive, open, safer and radical space, from which to evolve as people and as community. Open Source Technology is at the root of our philosophy, it enables us to share and collaborate without restrictions. We need this space to experiment with things as gender, hardware or our selves.
