# [Coded Cultures Openism] The Zine-Ship Manifest-Station

The Zine-ship is moving workshop station, an oasis, a library. A cross between a pirate ship & a urban garden.

Share & Give & Make & Take.

A workshop for zine-making & zine community planting.
The zine-ship is a mobile eco-system. A zine-hub that contains and ignites a moment of innovation from the concept, the production, the process, the exhibition to the archive. Materials like paper or binding thread & tools like scissors and pens are built into the frame for book-making.
Paper sails are hoisted! The makers are the motor!
Zine-ship is about making author-ship accessible to all, self-publishing & activating creativity.
