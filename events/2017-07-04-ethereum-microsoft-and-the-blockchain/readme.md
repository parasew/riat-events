# [Ethereum] Microsoft and the Blockchain

Microsoft has long been involved with the Blockchain space, particularly with Ethereum. In late 2015 they launched their Blockchain-as-a-Service Offering on Azure. Since then they have been working on many interesting solutions (Project Bletchley) such as Blockchain Fabric and in that context Cryptlets.

This time Johannes Zessin and Thomas Conté from Microsoft will talk about Microsoft’s activities in the Blockchain space.

Due to the increased interest in this Meetup we have had to move it to the Ovalhalle in MuseumsQuartier. There is a limited capacity of 190 places so please RSVP via Meetup.com

Microsoft and the Blockchain

Blockchain technology (respectively the combination of technologies that make up Blockchain) can and probably will have a huge impact on the way how entities like humans or organizations interact and especially how they are going to manage and transfer value. Microsoft realized this inherent potential and started to create respectively work on several products / services / offerings in the Blockchain space.

The first part of the presentation will be about Microsoft’s Cloud Platform “Azure” and related Blockchain (as a Service) offerings. It will encompass a general introduction to the Cloud platform and Blockchain as a Service, followed by a demo of the offerings.

We will then explore the frameworks and middleware Microsoft is working on to facilitate the development and deployment of Blockchain applications targeting enterprise Blockchain environments. This is realized by providing an abstraction layer on top of the most popular Blockchains like Ethereum to build decentralized applications using familiar programming languages.

About the speakers

Johannes Zessin works at Microsoft and develops solutions in the context of Microsoft's Cloud Platform "Azure" for customers in Austria. Besides that, he is actively involved in Microsoft's activities in the Blockchain space and listed as Subject Matter Expert in the company. His focus at the moment lies on establishing Blockchain technologies in corporate environments as well as building communities and partnerships to push on the development of Blockchain in general.

Thomas Conté has been with Microsoft for 10 years, the last 6 of which have been spent working on the Azure platform as a Technical Evangelist. Thomas' role is to help customers and partners better understand and use our platform, through code contributions and samples, publications and public speaking. In the last few years Thomas has focused on emerging workloads on the Azure platform, like Open Source Software, IoT, and more recently Blockchain, in close coordination with engineering and product teams. Thomas reports to the global Developer Experience organization based in Redmond, but was born and lives in Paris, France.
