2600 Meetings exist worldwide as a forum for all interested in technology to meet and talk about events in technology-land, learn, and teach. Meetings are open to anyone of any age or level of expertise. This is the first of the regular meeting for Vienna, Austria and will take place every first Friday at the RIAT institute.

We meet in a public area. Nobody is excluded. There is no admission charge or dues of any sort. We act in a responsible manner. We don't do illegal things and we don't cause problems for the place we're meeting in. We meet on the first Friday of the month between 5 pm and 8 pm local time. (the time has been extended to 10pm in our case).
