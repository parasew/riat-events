Matthias Tarasiewicz from RIAT Research Institute for Arts & Technology will be speaking at the biennial Victor Papanek Symposium in London.

The symposium is organised by Alison J Clarke and Leah Armstrong from the Victor J. Papanek Foundation and Department of Design History and Theory at the University of Applied Arts Vienna, and by Prof. Jeremy Aynsley, Tania Messell and Dora Souza Dias from the Internationalising Design History Research Cluster at the University of Brighton.

Questions of design and ethics take on a new currency, form and prescience in a post-industrial, ‘post-truth’ landscape. The biennial Papanek Symposium 2017 aims to generate new ideas and critical thinking on the state of ethics in design and architecture today.

A conference exploring the histories, legacies and values of international design organisations in a post-industrial, post-organisational world. The Victor J.
