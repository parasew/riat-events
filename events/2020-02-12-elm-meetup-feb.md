Are you interested in Elm? This meetup is for you! We are happy to help beginners getting started, setting up an elm development environment, discuss advanced topics and solve some exciting programming problems together.

We plan to organize a meetup every first wednesday of the month, have a talk at the beginning of every meetup and than have time for hands on activities like reviewing code, mob programming, writing examples for the official elm documentation, best practices or scaling elm apps.

There will be some free drinks and maybe some chocolate. Many thanks to riat.at for providing the space.

- Hands On: Mob Programming (Card Game 'Set')

If somebody wants to present her or his project, has suggestions for a talk or is generally interested in a specific topic regarding Elm or functional programming, please drop us a line.
