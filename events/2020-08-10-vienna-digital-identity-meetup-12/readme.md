We will have Dr. Oskar van Deventer from TNO in the Netherlands speaking on "Self-Sovereign Identity - The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly".

"Self-sovereign identity (SSI) promises to empower citizens with new means to manage privacy, elimination of logins, and much faster transactions via the internet as well as in real life. SSI promises to empower organisations to speed up and automate transactions with customers, suppliers and partners, resulting in huge savings on administrative costs, and higher customer satisfaction that results from better and speedier decision-making. This presentation illustrates the good side of SSI with a plethora of examples, comparing SSI-based business transactions with their current more cumbersome non-SSI equivalent. It also provides examples of the bad side, how SSI technology can be abused by unscrupulous organisations, and how a combination of technology,
education and legislation could reduce this risk. It finally presents examples of the ugly side, how SSI technology can be used by criminals, and what type of countermeasures are conceivable."

TNO is also one of the lead organizations for the ESSIF-Lab effort that is funding protocol layer and business layer projects.

Please join us, work on your questions and interaction with Oskar. He thrives on tough questions and interaction.
