After a bit of a break it is time for the next meetup! Starting September the meetup will take place (at least) once a month again.

In recent months a lot of progress has happened in regards to state channel development. Counterfactual released their paper (and some code) a few weeks ago. Some other projects have also released preliminary code for their implementations. Meanwhile projects like FunFair have been at the forefront of bringing state-channel-like technology into real applications.

As gas prices continue to remain high, bringing offchain scaling solutions into production is becoming more and more important. This meetup we will look at the current state of the implementation of state channels.
