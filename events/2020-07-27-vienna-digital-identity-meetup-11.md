We have in-person presentations from:

Oliver Terbu from Consensys will be giving an update on DIDcomm v2.

and

Adam Martin from Spherity.

Our half speaker ;-) will be our remote presenter Juan Caballero from Spherity.

As usual I will give a brief update on what is going on within the space and an update on upcoming events.

I am again running this as a hybrid event with both in person and online. If you are in Vienna, please come join us!

We will keep the appropriate distancing of seating!
