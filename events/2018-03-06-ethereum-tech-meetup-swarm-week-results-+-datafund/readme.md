Swarm, one of the three major protocols of ethereums web3 platform, is a distributed storage platform and content distribution service with an upcoming ethereum-based incentive layer for bandwidth as well as insurance for long term storage.

In early March 11 Swarm developers (including Viktor Tron) will meet at RIAT to hack on Swarm. On the 6th we will have a public event where you can learn about Swarm and talk to the developers. In addition Gregor Žavcer will talk about his Datafund project.

Agenda

1) Swarm

Presentations about Swarm. Details to follow.

2) Datafund

Datafund is a protocol and distributed application (dApp) that guards personal data, provides safe storage and enables data exchange. Information is shared on the need-to-know basis according to an agreement between exchanging parties. Datafund guards and protects the privacy of an individual while enabling companies to engage in fair data exchange.

The talk will be given by Gregor Žavcer, Datafund's cofounder. Gregor comes from economics and cognitive science background, has been part of blockchain community for several years and deeply believes that privacy is a human right.
