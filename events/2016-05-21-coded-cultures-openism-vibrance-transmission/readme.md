# [Coded Cultures Openism] Vibrance – Transmission

Transmission is the second night of the sound program for Coded Cultures features performances from Stallgewitter, Martin Howse, Krube and N.M.O.

Stallgewitter is the project of Daniel Löwenbrück and Marcellvs L. Daniel Löwenbrück is a German performance artist and composer of tape-music. His live-performances are of a concrete, poetic, ritualistic, therapeutic, and sometimes humourous nature, and often bordering on the absurd, mixing partly the tactics of the european art avantgardes (Actionism, Fluxus) with contemporary acousmatic music. Marcellvs L. is a Brazilian artist currently based between Berlin and Seyðisfjörður. He works in both video and sound, he has exhibited internationally since the mid 00’.

Martin Howse’s The Dark Interpreter/Dissolution subjects the human voice to material and crystalline process, to dissolution and to the voice-less noise of angels. Working with and through the electric modulation of the human voice as light passed through a crystal, The Dark Interpreter/Dissolution unites deep earth currents and atmospheric signals with vocal bone and tongue fragility, bringing to the light a new technological animism.‘

Martin Howse is occupied with an artistic investigation of the links between the earth (geophysical phenomena), software and the human psyche (psychogeophysics), proposing a return to animism within a critical misuse of scientific technology.
Alexander Schneider is a Berlin sound artist who has been working under the moniker Krube since 1999, creating musique concrète, electroacoustical compositions and field recordings.

N.M.O. is an acronym serving to frame the work of a rolling computerized ceremonial aerobics unit that operates in a hybrid territory between club music, performance and inventive forms of sound spatialisation. What they call ‘Military Danceable Space Music and/or Fluxus Techno’ is a unique blend of repetitive percussive patterns and synthetic sounds that combined with performative aspects explodes during their live shows.
From a club night intermezzo concept that begins with a bleep test from the the middle of the dancefloor to a site specific hybrid lecture that reduces the sound pressure level of a club performances but increases the degree of interactivity with the audience (incorporating the game of musical chairs), to outdoor performances with colored smoke grenades and flares that are all an attempt to question standardized formats of presentation of electronic music and ways to break with passive listening.
To follow their two releases on Barcelona’s Anòmia label, including 2014’s ‘critically acclaimed and standout’ 12», ‘Nederlandse Maatschappij Ontwikkeling’, their latest EP ‘Naturkunde Museum Ostkreuz’ for Boomkat’s label The Death of Rave put forward ‘a visceral, effectively unprecedented sound that’s hard to ignore.’ N.M.O. has recently released a proto-techno tinged concept 12» on Where To Now and a double 12» for Powell’s Diagonal Records to be released in early 2016.
