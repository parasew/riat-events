This 4-day course teaches the basics of smart contract development on the Ethereum platform using Solidity and the Truffle Framework. It covers the full workflow of developing, testing and deploying contracts as well as interacting with them afterwards. In addition you will learn about common contract patterns and potential security issues.
In this course you will learn

How the Ethereum smart contracts platform works in depth
How to write and properly test smart contracts
How to use the Truffle Development Framework
Which standards are out there and how to reuse well-tested code
How to deploy contracts and get them verified on block explorers
How to interact with contracts from the JavaScript side
About common contract patterns and when they are appropriate
How to avoid common security issues
How your UI can work with different browsers and wallets
The course starts everyday at 10:00 and ends approximately at 18:00, including a lunch break and is held in English. We do not provide devices needed for this course, so please bring your own device.

The course consists of three alternating main elements:

A presentation introducing and explaining all of the relevant concepts and details
Live coding of an example contract where participants can follow along
Code exercises where participants develop contracts by themselves
Rough daily schedule:

Day 1: Deep dive in Ethereum, Geth Tutorial, Truffle toolchain, Solidity Basics
Day 2: More Solidity, Deployment, OpenZeppelin, Testing
Day 3: More Testing, web3.js, Contract Design Patterns
Day 4: Contract Design Patterns, Security, Roadmap, Under the Hood
After the course participants can earn our “Smart Contract Developer” certificate (issued on the ethereum blockchain) by solving a number of off-site exercises. The certification program is additional, and not part of the course.
