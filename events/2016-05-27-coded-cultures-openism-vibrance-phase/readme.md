# [Coded Cultures Openism] Vibrance â€“ Phase

Vibrance: Phase features performances from Clemens Hausch [AT], Peter Kutin [AT], Stefan Brunner [AT] and Pedro Lopes [PT].

Vibrance brings together a selection of artists working with acoustic activity as primal material through the angle of cross-disciplinary practice. It acts as a catalyser of contemporary practices in the field of sound, open hardware and performativity, aiming to stage a scenario in which presence, simulation, chaos and fictional control operate as protagonists.

Clemens Hausch is a Vienna-based media artist, graphic designer, curator and head of the Moozak label. In his work he challenges the topic of artificial space from the perspective of sound. His sound performances utilize realtime signal processing in order to create shifting tectonic structures that envelop and absorb the listeners and transform the spatial reality that surrounds them.

Hausch's audio performance '/0', where division as most unlikely mathematical operator applied in audio production is the central component of this piece which aims to manifest mathematical processes as temporal physical structures that literally take (a) place in space. The deformation of the physical reality evoked by the translation of generated series of numbers into air pressure melts the virtual with the real in a palpable sense.

'The Hour of the Wolf' is an improvisational piece upon an associative score performed by Stefan Brunner and Pedro Lopes. Stefan & Pedro are both experienced performance artists who met at an innovators & creative conference where they were both invited as speakers discussing new musical interfaces and the impact of bodies in technology. Soon, they found out that they not only share a common musical taste, but are also neighbors in Berlin.

They quickly decided to go into the studio together, where they started working on 'The Hour of the Wolf, an improvisational piece by Stefan Brunner. The piece is based on an associative "story", divided into 8 chapters. Both musicians refect upon the structural text to generate an ever changing piece which, while being fully improvised, is still based on the solid foundation of a common storyline. Unlike most improvisational methodologies, the associative and structural aspects present in Hour of the Wolf allow for rapid intercuts between the musicians and a multi-layered dialog of emotions, sounds and images.

Peter Kutin is based in Vienna and works with sound. He has realised a wide variety of works within the field of contemporary and advanced electronic music. Often in combination with formats like cinema, film, compostion, theater, light- and soundart. His pieces have been shown and comissioned at various music- & filmfestivals across the globe and were described as "undeniably effective" by The Wire.
