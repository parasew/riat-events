RIAT will celebrate the end of the year with a small party and a talk from Hrvoje Hiršl, moderated by Aner Barzilay.

It all started with industrial revolution – steam machine and conveyor belt – the progressive shortening of time, space and possibility of reaction. In digital age it came to the scale of atoms and picoseconds – optical cables literally transfer information with a speed of light. If space and time are continuous, then by shortening the time, the space in which we operate shortens, and it becomes outside of our scale. For who is this space created for, that is, the lack of it?

Artist, Hrvoje Hiršl, will present last 5 years of his artistic research divided in 3 topics, ranging from the shortening of time and space under the influence of exponential technological progress to the position of the image in system-based society, and selforganization as a manifestation of group intelligence.

Some ideas, some works, some more talk. After the presentation he will be engaged in conversation with Aner Barzilay, PhD candidate in History, Yale University and the audience.

Hrvoje Hiršl is an Artist, Researcher and a Designer from Croatia. His art projects are at the crossing of contemporary art and media art discourse. His main themes range from materiality of the art object, deconstruction of its aura and the limitations of the medium. In the last five years his interests shifted more into structures, automation and cybernetics. His work encompasses: sound installations, video installations, interactive installations, prints, etc.

In 2012 nominated for Radoslav Putar Award for the best Croatian artist under 35. Recipient of the DordtYart Artists-in-Residence 2015, Dordrecht, Netherlands; TRIBE Residency 2013 (Istanbul, Prague, Ljubljana) and Kulturkontakt Artists in Residence 2012 (Vienna).

One of the Croatian Representatives at the Design Biennale in London in 2016. He is a member of AR.S (algoresearch.systems) research collective and founder of the I’MM_ Media Lab in Zagreb.

Aner Barzilay is currently completing his Ph.D. in modern European history at Yale University, where he is writing his dissertation on Michel Foucault’s reading of Nietzsche’s philosophy that is based on an unprecedented archival research in Foucault’s personal archive in France, which has only recently been opened for scholarship.

Specializing in intellectual history and the history of ideas, Aner is interested in questions pertaining to the philosophy of history, critical theory, and the way in which history and theory interact in order to explore affinities between technology, politics and aesthetics and their relationship to philosophical modernity. Aner currently holds an M.A./M.Phil from Yale University as well as a B.A. (cum laude) from Tel-Aviv University in history and philosophy. His latest article is forthcoming in the collected volume: Foucault, Neoliberalism and Beyond (Rowman & Littlefield Press).
