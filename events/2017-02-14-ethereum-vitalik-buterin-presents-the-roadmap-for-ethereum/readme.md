# [Ethereum] Vitalik Buterin presents the roadmap for ethereum

A one-day workshop theory and praxis on hidden signals reception and amplification. Experimental trans/communicative techniques with artist Víctor Mazón Gardoqui (ES/DE).

The seminar and hands on workshop introduces the methodology, praxis and new SIGNUM design. The device includes a transducer, phototransistor, coil, antenna, piezoelectric transducer and microphone capsule, which coheres sonically and allows users to listen and transmit to the surrounding signals that would fall out of the human hearing range. The workshop will also introduce participants to using the electromagnetic spectrum within artistic practices.

Listen to electromagnetic waves caused by modern devices and natural forces. Hear the patterns of ultraviolet and infrared light; the vibrations of ferric objects; the friction caused by insects and underwater sounds. Listen to the noise of tectonic movements, or of lighting phenomena thousands of kilometres distant.

Participants in the SIGNUM workshop will build and take home their own device, which is designed to record and listen to sounds hidden in the electromagnetic spectrum: those invisible frequencies, electromagnetic fields and signals that constantly surround us but that we are usually unable to hear.

The workshop will be lead by Victor Mazon Gardoqui, who’s the author of the workshop’s concept, electronics design and documentation.

No previous experience in electronics is necessary, but interest and patience mandatory.

SIGNUM device is a translator – it uncovers the encrypted codes of information and the language of man/machine communication- which remain unintelligible without technical aid. Sharpening our awareness about what surrounds us, we will capture radio waves, FM/AM, ultrasounds, translocal network connections, personal broadcast spaces, inaudible electromagnetic fields, photoelectric effects, etc, read with a micro controller like an Arduino, Pic or a raspberry pi. SIGNUM can be used for various applications and in different environments: for the measurement and analysis of different signals through its 8 sensors and inputs, for field recordings, music composition or for aesthetic purposes within the sound or visual art praxis, as it has the unique ability to provide a wide sound palette and hard-to-identify sounds. The device is intended as an experimental tool for educational purposes and artistic practice.

Tutor: Víctor Mazón Gardoqui
Coordination: RIAT Research Institute for Arts & Technology

Workshop fee: €15 (Paid at registration)
Device fee: €85 (Paid in cash at workshop)

The device fee covers all extra electronic materials, industrially produced electronic circuit board board with black matt finish and gold pads, 8 dedicated sensors to detect different signals from the spektrum and sonify lighting, ultra low frequency, convert visible and invisible light to sound and viceversa, etc...(Sensors: pickup, light sensor, transducer, coil, electret capsule, short loop antenna). Participants will keep all the build devices and sensors at the end of the workshop.
