Our next guest likes to cite Werner Vogels: "Everything fails, all the time." :-) Even though this citation "works for me" (!), does this mean we have to give up? Well ... it could also mean: we have to adapt to this fundamental truth.

But first things first ... :-)

... Microservices Vienna celebrates its second anniversary! Hans, Christoph and me want to invite you to celebrate this "birthday" a little bit more than we normally do! :-) RIAT will host us, so we have space and a bunch of cool cryptographic barkeepers serving us the free drinks sponsored by jumio and S-IT! Thank you so much!

... and then second things second ... do you maybe want to win one out of two tickets for the DevOne in Tabakfabrik Linz, April 11, 2019? Then you should join us, too! More infos about DevOne: https://devone.at/

But. This is of course not all we have to announce. What about speaker and topic? Maybe some of you still remember the LEGENDARY very FIRST talk about the "Promises and Perils of Microservices" back in 2017? Well, Uwe Friedrichsen, CTO and fellow of codecentric AG will join us again! And of course with a new topic. :-)

Uwe writes:

"We struggle with good functional design for about 50 years meanwhile, and we haven't solved the problem by far.

But while in the past bad design only meant a hard to maintain codebase, the consequences are much more drastic these days. In times of microservices, cloud native, API first and more, bad design also means brittle and poorly scalable systems at runtime, up to a level that can endanger the whole business.

So, good functional design is needed more desperately than ever. But, what is good design and how can we create it?

In this session, first we will examine, how functional design affects the properties of a system. Then, we will revisit some timeless design foundations from 50 years of computer science. After that, we will apply the concepts learned to our challenges today. Finally, we will look at the trade-offs of our approach and some alternative options.

After this session, you will have gained a better understanding how to design modern systems that are successful and sustainable in development and at runtime."
