A change of plan, we will be going over the some of the papers from the recent 8th Rebooting the Web of Trust (RWoT) and a special guest, Stephen Curran, will be Zoom'ing in.

First, RWoT is one of the two premier deep technical events of the Digital Identity Community. At this event is not a conference but a workshop. The Workshop produced a record 25 papers. The first part of the meetup will cover selected papers.

Second, Stephen will be doing a presentation of the Sovrin/Indy Ledger created by the Province of British Columbia (Verifiable Organization Network). Stephen will walk through the use case of VON and a demonstration of both OrgBook and AgentBook that they have put together.

I hope you can join us, I know it will be a fascinating and engaging conversation.
