We continue the events for the Vienna Digital Identity Meetup, with the next one being Identity and IoT. The DIDs and Verifiable Credentials is starting to gain attention within the IoT sector. There is hope that with the security and crypto around DIDs and VCs there may be a cost effective way to get high assurance identity into the IoT space.

We have two great speakers who will be Zooming in:

**Micha Roon, CTO The Energy Web Foundation**

> As the physical electricity grid decentralizes, the devices on it need to be included in the electricity markets used to manage the grid. Historically, only big assets were onboarded because of the onboarding costs. In this presentation, I want to show how onboarding assets can be decentralized and made more efficient and hence cheaper.

**Jelle Millenaar, Identity Lead for the IOTA Foundation**

> Automation has only just started. More and more infrastructure will be digitized, allowing real-time interactions and data sharing. This will lead to Smart cities that can act as an organism, receiving information from edge devices, and responding to the data as a whole. This system requires a layer of trust, where devices can be identified and trusted, based on decentralized identifiers. Through trust, we can enable data selling and purchasing, negotiations, outsourcing, and much more.

This will be both an in person and online event.
