This time we will look at what kinds of ethereum-based DEXs (decentralized exchanges) are around these days and how they function.

Agenda:

1) State of the DEXs

In this talk we will look at how some of the most popular (ethereum-based) decentralized exchanges actually work. We will

* look at how 0x, Ethfinex and OasisDex work
* give a brief overview of some others like KyberMarket or IDEX
* look at the state of DEXs for NFTs

2) Socializing
Afterwards feel free to chat with other cryptocurrency enthusiasts about Ethereum or whatever else you find interesting.
