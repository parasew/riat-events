# [Coded Cultures Openism] Open Scenarios for Non-Trivial Pursuits III: Rituals of Friendship & Scholarship

Open Scenarios for Non-Trivial Pursuits Day III

The publishing collective continent. assembles a programme of experimental and experiential, erkenntnis-oriented encounters where people driven by curiosity toward modes of friendship and scholarship support each other in their matters of concern – personal and professional intents forever colliding in "Open Scenarios for Non-Trivial Pursuits".

Friendship & Scholarship (Jamie Allen)

I want to do something about academic friendship and the love of knowing, as I have some idea that an intimacy with things and other people both is and should be much more central to everything we do as artists, writers, scholars, teachers, people. This seems to me particularly true if we want to escape the mythic pathologies of self-abuse, loneliness, laziness (how did we become so withdrawn that doing something, anything, gets called ‘accelerationism’?) and (spiritual) impoverishment that seem to be a mainstay of the individual-institutional relational condition. This scenario will involve propositional friendships. ‘Friends’ are supportively unknown, unknowable and can even be hard on one another. Can we be friends with institutions? What would you want from such a friendship, anyway?

“The role of the artist is exactly the same as the role of the lover. If I love you, I have to make you conscious of the things you don’t see.”

“Most of us must simply recognize that not much is happening and we are quite far from the levers of power. It is necessary, then, to make more friends.”


Global Material Pottery (Peter Moosgaard)

When machines are capable of doing all manual and informational work for us, we are free to play and regress like spoiled children. The Keynesian Utopia of a society of leisure also supports the rise of a “disposable life”, a transposition from a system that simply does not need people. In a scenario-building process, this workshop employs a global imaginary in which technology emancipates its (human) agents instead of merely using them as genitals (McKenna). The much trending “Art in the Athropocene” calls us to a new game (Huizinga), our new imaginary. The notion of the fetish has to be redefined: Waste Totems, Rare Earth Sculpting, Extinction Aesthetics, rituals metabolising global materials. According to leading mythologist Alan Moore (Watchmen, From Hell, Saga of the Swamp Thing) all culture evolved from cult - and possibly these anthropocenic desires can reflect in new rituals like the “workshop”, playing society, using participants merely as material processing agents.
