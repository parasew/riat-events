# [Presentation] Cryptoeconomics: Infrastructures & Artefacts

RIAT Research Institute for Arts & Technology presents its Cryptoeconomics: Infrastructures & Artefacts program at the BLOCKCHAIN evening hosted by Club Alpbach Oberösterreich in cooperation with the Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy.

Cryptoeconomics: Infrastructures & Artefacts offers insights into the crypto-economic condition and presents an overview of blockchain-related activities within Austria from 2011-2017. The program introduces the new work PROOF-OF-PRESENCE developed by DARC and the NEM Foundation which critically questions utopian/dystopian narratives of machine labour with a performative blockchain. One of the earliest blockchain based artworks “Bitcoincloud” by Artistic Bokeh is also exhibited alongside the Terra0 project; a self-owned forest that creates a scenario whereby a forest is able to sell licences to log trees through automated processes, smart contracts and blockchain technology. Terra0 will be presented by Hmpshr Mx, RIAT's current crypto-economic artist and researcher-in-residence with Q21 at MQ – MuseumsQuartier Wien.

Cryptoeconomics: Infrastructures & Artefacts is an ongoing program by RIAT that will be featured in various iterations over the next year, including Ars Electronica, Ethereum DEVCON and the The Future of Demonstration.

RIAT is an institute for research, development, communication and education in the fields of cryptoeconomics, the blockchain , experimental artistic technology and open hardware. It explores and actively stress-tests the role of research and development in the age of zero-trust, through novel forms of presentation, discussion and publication. Examining the global cryptoeconomic condition and its effects on culture and society, we foster an open and interdisciplinary discourse to improve crypto-literacy for the society of tomorrow.
