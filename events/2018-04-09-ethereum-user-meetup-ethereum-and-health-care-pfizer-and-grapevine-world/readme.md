This time will be all about health care. We'll have two companies (Pfizer and a startup) presenting about using blockchain in this sector.

1) Blockchain at Pfizer

Sascha will give a high level perspective about what is happening with Blockchain in big corporations such as Pfizer, and what the impact will be for the health care industry in general.

Sascha Mundstein (Harvard, INSEAD) is a digital engineer and emerging technology expert at Pfizer, where he has helped transform innovative ideas into solutions that benefit patients directly. In recent years, he has been focusing on mobile technologies, health data collection through sensors and trackers, scaling applications across multiple global markets and devising new analysis paradigms for patient data.

2) Grapevine World - Breaking Data Barriers and utilizing Blockchain to build a New Health Economy

Grapevine World is a decentralized, borderless ecosystem for the seamless exchange of health data in a standardized, secure manner. Populated with every stakeholder in health – from patients to pharma, care providers to payors, researchers and technologists – Grapevine World is the backbone of a new global health economy. Wernhard is the Project Lead and Co-Founder of the Grapevine blockchain initiative and ICO.
