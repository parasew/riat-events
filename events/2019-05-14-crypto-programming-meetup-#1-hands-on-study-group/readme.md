Hi,

We are back in May with a new format, that is, the 1st Crypto Programming Meetup at the Cryptoeconomics Futures Research Institute.

Learn Together - Hands-on Study Group

Bring your own (crypto) project and show & tell. Yes, you can. All programming languages welcome :-). We will sit around a round-table and study together or apart. Join us.

Talks - Show & Tell

1)
