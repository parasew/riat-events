Future Cryptoeconomics is an unusual publication: it is a hybrid of a magazine, newspaper or lab notebook printed on newspaper material with rotational print technique. Future Cryptoeconomics also is an experimental system, "artistic technology" where different forms of inquiry collide.

*The Genesis Stack*
In the genesis stack event the first and initial prints of the magazine (which have been held back from circulation) are inscribed in the chain of the world computer via NFT technology. This is the inaugural event and start of the *RIAT decentral archive for process artefacts* and is part of the exhibition "Data Loam: on the future of knowledge systems and the materiality of information".

*From the publication*
What is cryptoeconomics exactly, and what are we talking about when we are talking about “Future Cryptoeconomics”? We are facing a discipline which is not formally defined yet. It reminds us of the early developments of game theory, an area of study that at the beginning was very narrowly defined, but then grew to be an interdisciplinary field that included the social sciences, political sciences, and many other disciplines. In order to discuss the future developments of world computers, immutable code and cryptocurrency, we must broaden our viewpoints and make sure to understand the full scope of possibilities of true decentralisation. “Forking institutions” might be a starting point, but we have to be aware that this possibly also means a “constant destruction and recreation of institutions and experimental cultures”, to make space for invention and new disruptions.

Future Cryptoeconomics are debated and tested in almost real-time, and we have a long way to go in order to achieve ‘cryptoeconomic literacy’ and global adoption of cryptocurrency. Could anxiety foster mass adoption of cryptocurrencies? The transparency vs. privacy debate, or the shortcomings of fiat, banks and large financial institutions? Future Cryptoeconomics seeks not to find answers to speculations, but to identify the questions that are foundational for envisioning next societies.
