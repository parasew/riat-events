Dai is a Stablecoin implemented as an ERC-20 token on top of Ethereum which was launched last December by the MakerDAO platform (https://makerdao.com/). Its purpose is to maintain a stable price of about 1$ (USD). Up until now the token always has returned to that value.

In this meetup we will look at:
* how the Maker platform actually works
* how it was implemented
* how it performed thus far
* the long-term roadmap
* how decentralized this system really is
