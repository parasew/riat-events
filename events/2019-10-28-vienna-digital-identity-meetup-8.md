Well, it's hard to believe it will be almost two months since we last met for our special event!

In that time, there have been a bunch of big Identity Events.

In this Meetup we will be giving a briefing on each of:

- Rebooting the Web of Trust
- TPAC
- MyData Global
- Internet Identity Workshop

Four of the more significant identity technology events in the calendar.
