# [Making Artistic Technology] Artist Talk: Marita Fraser

Marita Fraser: What is cast in the Shadow

RIAT/Q21 Artist-in-Residence Marita Fraser will reflect on speculative fiction, vibrant matter and material agency in things. Marita's art and research examines the visualisation of structures and diagrams, both scientific and aesthetic. Her work has been described to use "non-sequitous text, along with blockish divisions of colour and unconventional frames [...] to shift focus, guide the eye, or obfuscate parts of the visual plane from the viewer." Marita is currently a researcher at the Royal College of Art in London, she formerly studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and Sydney College of the Arts. She is currently artist in residence at Q21 Vienna on the invitation of RIAT. The residency is supported by Austria Australia Arts.
