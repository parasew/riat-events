In this forkshop, the Laboratory for Future Cryptoeconomics will identify and work on future histories of data-driven and consensus-oriented cultures by investigating the face value of blockchain narratives. Despite a history of critical debates undermining the concept, consensus as truth exists and thrives in practice today. This is the evident in the emergence of post-truth media societies that have led to changes in society based on foundations of truth that are sustained only through consensus. Cryptoeconomics offers an alternative approach by reversing the incentivization of truth. In the cryptosphere, conflicts are the driving force of innovation; forking is a method of resolution. Conflicts appear in coding communities on a regular basis, and protocols for resolution have to exist in order to continue development. A “fork” in software engineering describes the situation when developers create their own “branch” and start individual development on it.

Presented in cooperation with RIAT.Space.
