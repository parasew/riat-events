In 'Open Scenarios for Non-Trivial Pursuits', the publishing collective continent. assembles a programme of experimental and experiential, erkenntnis-oriented encounters where people driven by curiosity toward modes of friendship and scholarship support each other in their matters of concern – personal and professional intents forever colliding in "Open Scenarios for Non-Trivial Pursuits".

The second day of the program, 'Hyperconnected' features a guided visit to 'Hyperconnected: The Whole Picture' at Palais des Beaux Arts Wien followed by a Systemic Structure Seance (Applied Demonology) with Karin Ferrari at the Angewandte Malerei.

The visual encodings marking the digital interface might be possessed with a subversive symbolic potential. The symbolic dimension of the digital interface desires to be recognized and examined, which will also unleash its magical transformative power. Is the wireless icon the antidotal counterpart to the all-seeing eye? Or are we simply already entangled in the ever present surplus of symbolic meaning?

In 'Hyperconnected (The Whole Picture)', Karin Ferrari introduces a speculative chart mapping the flux of meanings between a cluster of icons related to the web. By appropriating and re-envisioning mimetic signs and their syntactical relations, new technicoloured virtual possibilities emerge from the ominous undercurrents that flow through planetary telecommunication networks and archaic power structures. Next time you touch a WiFi symbol, a different kind of connection might be established.
