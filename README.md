# RIAT events

This is the Github for events and participations of the [RIAT Institute](https://riat.at). RIAT is a research institute working with future cryptoeconomics, open source hardware and privacy technologies. You can find current job offers and positions [here](https://riat.at/jobs).

The main aim of this repo is to have a central point for past events, as the institute exists since quite some time, and documentation is scattered in many places. This repo also feeds the RIAT website. Please go and read our [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Institute_for_Arts_and_Technology) if you don't know who we are.


## Extending the events archive

If you find something online or missing in the list here, [please open an issue](https://github.com/parasew/riat-events/issues/new) or create a pull request. You can [read the howto](https://github.com/parasew/riat-events/blob/master/todo/readme.md) in order to understand better how to contribute. The [events archive](https://github.com/parasew/riat-events/tree/master/archive) usually is a good starting point.
