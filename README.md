# RIAT events

This is the Github for events and participations of the [RIAT Institute](https://riat.at).
The main aim of this repo is to have a central point for past events, as the institute exists since quite some time, and documentation is scattered in many places. This repo also feeds the new RIAT website.

## Extending the events archive

If you find something online or missing in the list here, [please open an issue](https://github.com/parasew/riat-events/issues/new) or create a pull request. You can [read the howto](https://github.com/parasew/riat-events/blob/master/todo/readme.md) in order to understand better how to contribute. The [events archive](https://github.com/parasew/riat-events/tree/master/archive) usually is a good starting point.
